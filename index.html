X.com merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 20022. Musk formerly owned x.com when he was a co-founder at PayPal but lost the domain when the company went public and he left. Musk purchased the domain back for an undisclosed sum earlier this month. <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">more...</a>
